**Follow these steps to contribute:**

Find an issue to work with the tag '[first-timers-only](https://github.com/cloudcalldev/crud-boilerplate/labels/first-timers-only)' or '[up-for-grabs](https://github.com/cloudcalldev/crud-boilerplate/labels/up-for-grabs)'. Or Raise a [new issue](https://github.com/cloudcalldev/crud-boilerplate/issues/new)

3. Let us know you are working on the issue by commenting on it. Make sure that you submit your pull request within a week of claiming it incase someone else wants to do it. [1]

4. Follow the [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTE.md) and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

If you're new to open source or this is your first Pull Request - you can learn by reading the [Official Github How to Contribute to Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) or watching the series [How to Contribute to Open Source on Github](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)


## Setup Locally
1. Fork and clone the repo (Develop Branch)
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name of your change - `git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-change`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` in your terminal. This will spin up a local version of the API at http://localhost:1337
5. Make your changes
6. Run `npm test`
7. If the tests pass then commit
8. Submit a PR against the Develop Branch and make sure the CI passes
9. Once a pull request has been approved it will be merged into the Develop Branch.
10. Only then once it has gone through a final screening will it be pulled through to the Master branch.
